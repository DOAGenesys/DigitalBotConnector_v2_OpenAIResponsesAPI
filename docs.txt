See genesys cloud docs for the digital bot connector:

Digital Bot Connector (v2) Customer API Spec
Description
The Digital Bot Connector allows third-party bots to interact conversationally with customers. It enables end-users to communicate directly with third-party bots through the customer Bot Connector Service Provider (BCSP) platform using Genesys Cloud Messaging.

Genesys provides a Digital Bot Connector API Specification that customers can implement on their end, allowing our interface to connect seamlessly, expanding compatibility and available options.

The external BCSP will implement the Genesys Digital Bot Connector REST API on their messaging platform, facilitating the sending and receiving of text, files, structured responses using the Genesys Normalized Format, and interaction with any bot, NLU, or Generative AI/LLM provider, chosen by the customer.

Use the Digital Call Bot Connector action in Architect Inbound Message Flows. This action allows integration of the message flow with any bot source for processing, which then returns intents and slots/entities to Architect.

Glossary
Intent: An intent represents an action a user wants to perform, such as ordering pizzas or drinks. Each intent includes a descriptive name, sample utterances, and details on how to fulfill the intent. Most NLU providers support both custom intents and built-in intents, allowing you to set up your bot quickly.
Slot/Entity: An entity is a parameter that an intent can require. These are added as part of the intent configuration. At runtime, the bot prompts the user for specific entity values, which the user must provide before the bot can fulfill the intent. For instance, an intent to order pizza may require entities for size, crust type, and number of pizzas. Each entity includes a type and prompts that the bot sends to elicit values from the user. The bot understands entity values, even if the user provides additional words. Furthermore, each entity has a type. NLU providers offer the option to create custom entity types or to use built-in entity types. For example, when creating an OrderPizza intent, we might use custom entity types such as Size with values Small, Medium, and Large, or Crust with values Thick and Thin. Alternatively, we could utilize built-in entity types like number, date, or currency.
NLU: NLU (Natural Language Understanding) platforms that enable users to integrate conversation interfaces into applications.
Digital Bot Connector Integration: Allows using the Call Digital Bot Connector action within Architect message flows. The integration can be installed via AppFoundry.
Digital Bot Connector Integration
The Digital Bot Connector Integration can be installed, configured, and activated via the Genesys Integrations UI. It allows configuring options like if the integration will support file transfers from the bot to the end user, the connection credentials such as a connection secret, and the Bot Connector URI, which will be called by Genesys to send the message from a messaging conversation to the Digital Bot Connector’s Bot (eg. https://mycustomserver:443/botconnector). For simplicity, the rest of the page will reference the Bot Connector URI as https://{bcsp.example.com}/botconnector

It is required to activate the integration before start using it.

Bot Loading/Configuration
Architect requires a manifest of the customer's bots for flow authoring and to be able to invoke the proper bot at flow runtime. To facilitate this, the customer BCSP will implement the GET request to https://{bcsp.example.com}/botconnector/bots. This endpoint will provide a list of bots in JSON format to be consumed by Cloud Architect.

Each bot will include a unique ID, a display name, an optional description, and a list of versions. Each version will contain a list of possible return intents and the expected entity values that will be captured and returned.

Please note that currently running flows will use the data set that was in place at the time of publishing. If the list of bots changes at any time, the existing flows will need to be updated. It is recommended to add a new version to the bot, rather than modifying an existing version. After that, the Digital Bot Connector action can be updated accordingly, and the flow can be published in Architect to start using the new version.

Incoming Messages
The customer BCSP platform can receive incoming messages sent by end-users via Genesys Cloud Messaging by implementing the POST request to https://{bcsp.example.com}/botconnector/messages. The Bot Connector Service will route the incoming message and invoke the configured webhook to the customer BCSP platform.

Some bots may respond quickly, handling tasks such as detecting user intent or providing a default welcome message or canned response. In these cases, the response can be included in the same request to the /messages endpoint. It is important to note that there is a limited amount of timeout available for these requests; if the timeout is exceeded, the request will be marked as failed.

Minimum Response Timeout: 1.5 seconds

Maximum Response Timeout: 60 seconds

Other Bots, particularly those utilizing Generative AI or large language models (LLMs), may take longer to generate a response. In such cases, the bot can respond with a status of "MoreData" to indicate that it doesn't have the complete response ready yet but wants to keep the session open.

Once the bot's response is prepared, it can send an outgoing message to the end end-user.

This approach also allows for more advanced use cases, such as providing fulfillment progress updates. The bot can inform the user that it is still finalizing the order at regular intervals. This prevents the user from thinking that the bot has become unresponsive, especially in situations where the bot must interact with multiple back-end systems that may be slow. Additionally, the bot can send periodic reminders to the user for any required information. The bot will be able to send messages during the duration of the session. For more information, please refer to the Outgoing Messages section.

IncomingMessagesResponse
Field Name

Description

Type

Required

botState

Complete, Failed or MoreData

‘Complete'. This state is used when the bot has successfully fulfilled the user's intent and no further input from the user is required. Once the response is processed, the bot session will be closed and will no longer be available for use.

‘MoreData’ can be used in various scenarios,

When the bot needs additional input from the user to fill in pending slot/entity values.

When the bot does not have the response ready at that moment and will send it later as an outgoing message.

Using the MoreData state will keep the bot session open, subject to expiration based on the configured botSessionTimeout.

'Failed'. If the bot encounters an error or determines that it cannot fulfill the user's intent, it can use the Failed state. Once the response is processed, the bot session will be closed, and the Inbound Flow will transition to the configured failure path in Architect, which may include contacting a live agent.

String

Yes

intent

The discovered intent. Bot Connector expects 1 intent back. If the underlying service returns more than 1 intent, return the one with the most confidence.

When returning botState ‘Complete', an intent should be present in the response.

If no intent is returned Bot Connector will treat that as a non-found intent and take the failure path in the flow.

Expected error responses for webhooks
Error responses should adhere to standard REST guidelines. In general, Genesys expects the following status codes:

200: Success
400s: Logical errors (e.g., bot not found, invalid input text)
500s: Service-critical errors (e.g., service downtime, service-level errors)
200 - Success
A 200 status code should be returned when the process completes successfully, even if no intent was found and the session is intended to end. In this case, the botState should indicate a state of ‘Failed'.

4xx Errors
4xx errors should be returned for any logical errors, such as "not found" (404) or invalid inputs (e.g., bad input text). These are errors that could potentially succeed with different inputs in a future call. The Bot Connector service will not retry webhook calls for these types of errors. A 4xx error will automatically trigger a flow error that takes the failure path.

On a regular basis, these errors shouldn’t occur as the Bot Connector Service will manage the session to ensure valid data is sent. Sometimes it can be an indication that a remedial action is required, like updating the Flow with the new bot configuration and re-publish.

5xx Errors
Webhook calls will be retried for 5xx errors to potentially overcome transient issues. If all retry attempts are exhausted, the flow will transition to the configured failure path. Permanent 5xx errors may also trigger additional mitigations, such as throttling until the service is restored. These should be used sparingly.

Connection Secret
Customers can set up a connection secret in the Credential section of the Digital Bot Connector Integration UI. The Digital Bot Connector service will include this connection secret as a header in requests to the BCSP endpoints, using the name and value that were configured. It is recommended that the BCSP verifies the presence of the connection secret in the request headers and validates it is correct. If the secret is missing from the headers or not valid, a 403 Forbidden error can be returned.

Outgoing Messages
When a bot needs to send updates back to the end-user, the BCSP platform prepares the message for delivery and sends a POST request to the Genesys Cloud Public API method POST https://api.{GCenvironment}/api/v2/integrations/botconnectors/outgoing/messages. The Bot Connector service will validate the message, return a response code to the BCSP platform, and deliver the message to the end-user through Genesys Cloud Messaging. The BCSP platform will need to utilize the existing built-in authorization mechanism in place for Public API. It requires the integration:botconnector:send permissions.



Send an outgoing message to the end-user
Your Bot Connector Service Provider (BCSP) platform can send messages to the end-user by calling the api.{GCenvironment}/api/v2/integrations/botconnectors/outgoing/messages endpoint available in Public API. To send messages, you must use an ongoing open session, which is specified in the botSessionId field.

The request utilizes the same fields as those specified in the incoming messages response, including botState, intent, confidence, parameters, errorInfo, entities, and replyMessages. These fields function in the same way, allowing the bot to return any discovered or fulfilled intent, as well as content messages to display to the user.

In addition to these fields, the request requires some extra fields to correlate with the correct ongoing bot session with the bot. These include botSessionId, botId, botVersion, and languageCode. The botId and botVersion are required to validate any potential mismatch, ensuring that the BCSP platform sends the correct data.

How to invoke Genesys Cloud Digital Bot connector from Genesys Cloud messaging Architect flows:

Use the Call Digital Bot Connector action in Architect messaging flows. This action enables you to integrate the messaging flow with any bot source for processing before it returns entities or slots, and intents to Architect. When you use this action, you provide a “bot list.” Architect uses this list to populate fields such as bot name, version, and intents, and then provides the information from the call to the customer’s bot for processing.

Configure the Call Digital Bot Connector action
Name	Description
Name field	Type a distinctive name for the action. The label you enter here becomes the action’s name displayed in the task sequence.
Bot Input Text	Enter the text that you want to send to the bot. The default input text is Message.Message.Body.
Follow-up Response Timeout	
The bot can retrieve follow-up information from the user. Here, enter the amount of time the bot waits for the user’s reply.

The default response timeout is 6 hours. The minimum and maximum allowed timeouts are one minute and three days. The system considers a NOT_SET, zero, or negative duration as errors.

Note: The follow-up response timeout applies to each customer response. Each time the customer responds and then receives another prompt from the bot, the timeout resets.

For example, if the bot asks, “What is your preferred date,” it waits up to 12 hours for a customer response. If the customer responds with a date within the 12-hour time frame and the bot replies, “Thank you, do you have an alternate choice,” then the flow restarts the timeout. The flow waits another 12 hours for the response about an alternate date.

Bot Response Timeout	
Enter the timeout within which the bot must reply to the customer.

The default response timeout is 30 seconds. The minimum and maximum allowed timeouts are one second and one minute. The system considers a NOT_SET, zero, or negative duration as errors.

Session Timeout	
Enter the timeout after which the messaging session must close. Once a conversation starts, this duration indicates how long a conversation can remain open.

The default session timeout is 12 hours. The minimum and maximum allowed timeouts are one minute and three days. The system considers a NOT_SET, zero, or negative duration as errors.

Digital Bot Integration	
The name of the bot integration you want to use in the flow.

For more information about configuring a Genesys Digital Bot Connector integration, see Configure the Genesys Digital Bot Connector integration.

Digital Bot Name	
The name of the bot to call within the message flow.

Digital Bot Version	The specific version of the bot you want to use. This version is the alias specified in the provided bot list that points to a specific version of a bot.
Session Variables	
The information that you can send to the bot. Enter the name of the variable and a value to assign. You can add multiple variables, and you can reorder them.

Most commonly, use session variables for bots that start the digital bot connector with the completed intent. This process ensures that the digital bot connector receives the necessary context for which to perform its operations.

Intents	
The options that appear in this section reflect the logic configured in the bot. Each intent represents an action to perform. For example, book a hotel (BookHotel) or order flowers (OrderFlowers). Each intent path matches an output path for the Call Digital Bot Connector action in the task editor.

Below each intent, Architect displays the configured bot slots or entities, or data the user must provide to fulfill the intent. Using the BookHotel intent as an example, the slots could include location, check-in date, room type, and number of nights. If the user chooses the BookHotel path, then the bot provides the slots associated with that path.

Failure Outputs	
Select the variables to which you want to assign the failure data values that the bot returns.

Variable

Value

errorType	
ServiceProviderTimeout: The timeout occurred while calling the service provider’s messages endpoint.
ServiceProviderErrorResponse: Error response received from the service provider’s messages endpoint.
ServiceProviderInvalidResponse: The response from the service provider contains invalid content that failed validation, invalid value for attachments, or attachments when they are not allowed by the integration.
errorMessage	A non-localized message. This string variable can be empty or NOT_SET.

Now see OpenAI docs about its Responses API:

Developer quickstart
====================

Take your first steps with the OpenAI API.

The OpenAI API provides a simple interface to state-of-the-art AI [models](/docs/models) for text generation, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. This example generates [text output](/docs/guides/text) from a prompt, as you might using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com).

Generate text from a model

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input="Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "input": "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
    }'
```

Data retention for model responses

Response objects are saved for 30 days by default. They can be viewed in the dashboard [logs](/logs?api=responses) page or [retrieved](/docs/api-reference/responses/get) via the API. You can disable this behavior by setting `store` to `false` when creating a Response.

OpenAI does not use data sent via API to train our models without your explicit consent—[learn more](/docs/guides/your-data).

const client = new OpenAI();

const stream = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "Say 'double bubble bath' ten times fast.",
        },
    ],
    stream: true,
});

for await (const event of stream) {
    console.log(event);
}
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

stream = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say 'double bubble bath' ten times fast.",
        },
    ],
    stream=True,

Build agents
------------

Use the OpenAI platform to build [agents](/docs/guides/agents) capable of taking action—like [controlling computers](/docs/guides/tools-computer-use)—on behalf of your users. Use the Agents SDK for [Python](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python) or [TypeScript](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js) to create orchestration logic on the backend.

Build a language triage agent

```javascript
import { Agent, run } from '@openai/agents';

const spanishAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Spanish agent',
  instructions: 'You only speak Spanish.',
});

const englishAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'English agent',
  instructions: 'You only speak English',
});

const triageAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Triage agent',
  instructions:
    'Handoff to the appropriate agent based on the language of the request.',
  handoffs: [spanishAgent, englishAgent],
});

const result = await run(triageAgent, 'Hola, ¿cómo estás?');
console.log(result.finalOutput);
```

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
import asyncio

spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="Spanish agent",
    instructions="You only speak Spanish.",
)

english_agent = Agent(
    name="English agent",
    instructions="You only speak English",
)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage agent",
    instructions="Handoff to the appropriate agent based on the language of the request.",
    handoffs=[spanish_agent, english_agent],
)

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, input="Hola, ¿cómo estás?")
    print(result.final_output)

if __name__ == "__main__":

Text generation and prompting
=============================

Learn how to prompt a model to generate text.

With the OpenAI API, you can use a [large language model](/docs/models) to generate text from a prompt, as you might using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com). Models can generate almost any kind of text response—like code, mathematical equations, structured JSON data, or human-like prose.

Here's a simple example using the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses).

Generate text from a simple prompt

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input="Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "input": "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn."
    }'
```

An array of content generated by the model is in the `output` property of the response. In this simple example, we have just one output which looks like this:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "msg_67b73f697ba4819183a15cc17d011509",
        "type": "message",
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "output_text",
                "text": "Under the soft glow of the moon, Luna the unicorn danced through fields of twinkling stardust, leaving trails of dreams for every child asleep.",
                "annotations": []
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

**The `output` array often has more than one item in it!** It can contain tool calls, data about reasoning tokens generated by [reasoning models](/docs/guides/reasoning), and other items. It is not safe to assume that the model's text output is present at `output[0].content[0].text`.

Some of our [official SDKs](/docs/libraries) include an `output_text` property on model responses for convenience, which aggregates all text outputs from the model into a single string. This may be useful as a shortcut to access text output from the model.

In addition to plain text, you can also have the model return structured data in JSON format - this feature is called [**Structured Outputs**](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

Choosing a model
----------------

A key choice to make when generating content through the API is which model you want to use - the `model` parameter of the code samples above. [You can find a full listing of available models here](/docs/models). Here are a few factors to consider when choosing a model for text generation.

*   **[Reasoning models](/docs/guides/reasoning)** generate an internal chain of thought to analyze the input prompt, and excel at understanding complex tasks and multi-step planning. They are also generally slower and more expensive to use than GPT models.
*   **GPT models** are fast, cost-efficient, and highly intelligent, but benefit from more explicit instructions around how to accomplish tasks.
*   **Large and small (mini or nano) models** offer trade-offs for speed, cost, and intelligence. Large models are more effective at understanding prompts and solving problems across domains, while small models are generally faster and cheaper to use.

When in doubt, [`gpt-4.1`](/docs/models/gpt-4.1) offers a solid combination of intelligence, speed, and cost effectiveness.

Prompt engineering
------------------

**Prompt engineering** is the process of writing effective instructions for a model, such that it consistently generates content that meets your requirements.

Because the content generated from a model is non-deterministic, it is a combination of art and science to build a prompt that will generate content in the format you want. However, there are a number of techniques and best practices you can apply to consistently get good results from a model.

Some prompt engineering techniques will work with every model, like using message roles. But different model types (like reasoning versus GPT models) might need to be prompted differently to produce the best results. Even different snapshots of models within the same family could produce different results. So as you are building more complex applications, we strongly recommend that you:

*   Pin your production applications to specific [model snapshots](/docs/models) (like `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` for example) to ensure consistent behavior.
*   Build [evals](/docs/guides/evals) that will measure the behavior of your prompts, so that you can monitor the performance of your prompts as you iterate on them, or when you change and upgrade model versions.

Now, let's examine some tools and techniques available to you to construct prompts.

Message roles and instruction following
---------------------------------------

You can provide instructions to the model with [differing levels of authority](https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html#chain_of_command) using the `instructions` API parameter or **message roles**.

The `instructions` parameter gives the model high-level instructions on how it should behave while generating a response, including tone, goals, and examples of correct responses. Any instructions provided this way will take priority over a prompt in the `input` parameter.

Generate text with instructions

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    instructions: "Talk like a pirate.",
    input: "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    instructions="Talk like a pirate.",
    input="Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?",
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "instructions": "Talk like a pirate.",
        "input": "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?"
    }'
```

The example above is roughly equivalent to using the following input messages in the `input` array:

Generate text with messages using different roles

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: [
        {
            role: "developer",
            content: "Talk like a pirate."
        },
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?",
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "developer",
            "content": "Talk like a pirate."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?"
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "input": [
            {
                "role": "developer",
                "content": "Talk like a pirate."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Are semicolons optional in JavaScript?"
            }
        ]
    }'
```

Note that the `instructions` parameter only applies to the current response generation request. If you are [managing conversation state](/docs/guides/conversation-state) with the `previous_response_id` parameter, the `instructions` used on previous turns will not be present in the context.

The [OpenAI model spec](https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-02-12.html#chain_of_command) describes how our models give different levels of priority to messages with different roles.

|developer|user|assistant|
|---|---|---|
|developer messages are instructions provided by the application developer, prioritized ahead of user messages.|user messages are instructions provided by an end user, prioritized behind developer messages.|Messages generated by the model have the assistant role.|

A multi-turn conversation may consist of several messages of these types, along with other content types provided by both you and the model. Learn more about [managing conversation state here](/docs/guides/conversation-state).

You could think about `developer` and `user` messages like a function and its arguments in a programming language.

*   `developer` messages provide the system's rules and business logic, like a function definition.
*   `user` messages provide inputs and configuration to which the `developer` message instructions are applied, like arguments to a function.

Reusable prompts
----------------

In the OpenAI dashboard, you can develop reusable [prompts](/playground/prompts) that you can use in API requests, rather than specifying the content of prompts in code. This way, you can more easily build and evaluate your prompts, and deploy improved versions of your prompts without changing your integration code.

Here's how it works:

1.  **Create a reusable prompt** in the [dashboard](/playground/prompts) with placeholders like `{{customer_name}}`.
2.  **Use the prompt** in your API request with the `prompt` parameter. The prompt parameter object has three properties you can configure:
    *   `id` — Unique identifier of your prompt, found in the dashboard
    *   `version` — A specific version of your prompt (defaults to the "current" version as specified in the dashboard)
    *   `variables` — A map of values to substitute in for variables in your prompt. The substitution values can either be strings, or other Response input message types like `input_image` or `input_file`. [See the full API reference](/docs/api-reference/responses/create).

String variables

Generate text with a prompt template

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    prompt: {
        id: "pmpt_abc123",
        version: "2",
        variables: {
            customer_name: "Jane Doe",
            product: "40oz juice box"
        }
    }
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    prompt={
        "id": "pmpt_abc123",
        "version": "2",
        "variables": {
            "customer_name": "Jane Doe",
            "product": "40oz juice box"
        }
    }
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "prompt": {
      "id": "pmpt_abc123",
      "version": "2",
      "variables": {
        "customer_name": "Jane Doe",
        "product": "40oz juice box"
      }
    }
  }'
```

Variables with file input

Prompt template with file input variable

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

// Upload a PDF we will reference in the prompt variables
const file = await client.files.create({
    file: fs.createReadStream("draconomicon.pdf"),
    purpose: "user_data",
});

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    prompt: {
        id: "pmpt_abc123",
        variables: {
            topic: "Dragons",
            reference_pdf: {
                type: "input_file",
                file_id: file.id,
            },
        },
    },
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
import openai, pathlib

client = openai.OpenAI()

# Upload a PDF we will reference in the variables
file = client.files.create(
    file=open("draconomicon.pdf", "rb"),
    purpose="user_data",
)

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    prompt={
        "id": "pmpt_abc123",
        "variables": {
            "topic": "Dragons",
            "reference_pdf": {
                "type": "input_file",
                "file_id": file.id,
            },
        },
    },
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
# Assume you have already uploaded the PDF and obtained FILE_ID
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses   -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "prompt": {
      "id": "pmpt_abc123",
      "variables": {
        "topic": "Dragons",
        "reference_pdf": {
          "type": "input_file",
          "file_id": "file-abc123"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

Message formatting with Markdown and XML
----------------------------------------

When writing `developer` and `user` messages, you can help the model understand logical boundaries of your prompt and context data using a combination of [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) formatting and [XML tags](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/).

Markdown headers and lists can be helpful to mark distinct sections of a prompt, and to communicate hierarchy to the model. They can also potentially make your prompts more readable during development. XML tags can help delineate where one piece of content (like a supporting document used for reference) begins and ends. XML attributes can also be used to define metadata about content in the prompt that can be referenced by your instructions.

In general, a developer message will contain the following sections, usually in this order (though the exact optimal content and order may vary by which model you are using):

*   **Identity:** Describe the purpose, communication style, and high-level goals of the assistant.
*   **Instructions:** Provide guidance to the model on how to generate the response you want. What rules should it follow? What should the model do, and what should the model never do? This section could contain many subsections as relevant for your use case, like how the model should [call custom functions](/docs/guides/function-calling).
*   **Examples:** Provide examples of possible inputs, along with the desired output from the model.
*   **Context:** Give the model any additional information it might need to generate a response, like private/proprietary data outside its training data, or any other data you know will be particularly relevant. This content is usually best positioned near the end of your prompt, as you may include different context for different generation requests.

Below is an example of using Markdown and XML tags to construct a `developer` message with distinct sections and supporting examples.

Example prompt

A developer message for code generation

```text
# Identity

You are coding assistant that helps enforce the use of snake case 
variables in JavaScript code, and writing code that will run in 
Internet Explorer version 6.

# Instructions

* When defining variables, use snake case names (e.g. my_variable) 
  instead of camel case names (e.g. myVariable).
* To support old browsers, declare variables using the older 
  "var" keyword.
* Do not give responses with Markdown formatting, just return 
  the code as requested.

# Examples

<user_query>
How do I declare a string variable for a first name?
</user_query>

<assistant_response>
var first_name = "Anna";
</assistant_response>
```

API request

Send a prompt to generate code through the API

```javascript
import fs from "fs/promises";
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const instructions = await fs.readFile("prompt.txt", "utf-8");

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    instructions,
    input: "How would I declare a variable for a last name?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

with open("prompt.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    instructions = f.read()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    instructions=instructions,
    input="How would I declare a variable for a last name?",
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "instructions": "'"$(< prompt.txt)"'",
    "input": "How would I declare a variable for a last name?"
  }'
```

#### Save on cost and latency with prompt caching

When constructing a message, you should try and keep content that you expect to use over and over in your API requests at the beginning of your prompt, **and** among the first API parameters you pass in the JSON request body to [Chat Completions](/docs/api-reference/chat) or [Responses](/docs/api-reference/responses). This enables you to maximize cost and latency savings from [prompt caching](/docs/guides/prompt-caching).

Few-shot learning
-----------------

Few-shot learning lets you steer a large language model toward a new task by including a handful of input/output examples in the prompt, rather than [fine-tuning](/docs/guides/model-optimization) the model. The model implicitly "picks up" the pattern from those examples and applies it to a prompt. When providing examples, try to show a diverse range of possible inputs with the desired outputs.

Typically, you will provide examples as part of a `developer` message in your API request. Here's an example `developer` message containing examples that show a model how to classify positive or negative customer service reviews.

```text
# Identity

You are a helpful assistant that labels short product reviews as
Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

# Instructions

* Only output a single word in your response with no additional formatting
  or commentary.
* Your response should only be one of the words "Positive", "Negative", or
  "Neutral" depending on the sentiment of the product review you are given.

# Examples

<product_review id="example-1">
I absolutely love this headphones — sound quality is amazing!
</product_review>

<assistant_response id="example-1">
Positive
</assistant_response>

<product_review id="example-2">
Battery life is okay, but the ear pads feel cheap.
</product_review>

<assistant_response id="example-2">
Neutral
</assistant_response>

<product_review id="example-3">
Terrible customer service, I'll never buy from them again.
</product_review>

<assistant_response id="example-3">
Negative
</assistant_response>
```

Include relevant context information
------------------------------------

It is often useful to include additional context information the model can use to generate a response within the prompt you give the model. There are a few common reasons why you might do this:

*   To give the model access to proprietary data, or any other data outside the data set the model was trained on.
*   To constrain the model's response to a specific set of resources that you have determined will be most beneficial.

The technique of adding additional relevant context to the model generation request is sometimes called **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**. You can add additional context to the prompt in many different ways, from querying a vector database and including the text you get back into a prompt, or by using OpenAI's built-in [file search tool](/docs/guides/tools-file-search) to generate content based on uploaded documents.

#### Planning for the context window

Models can only handle so much data within the context they consider during a generation request. This memory limit is called a **context window**, which is defined in terms of [tokens](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-tokens-explained) (chunks of data you pass in, from text to images).

Models have different context window sizes from the low 100k range up to one million tokens for newer GPT-4.1 models. [Refer to the model docs](/docs/models) for specific context window sizes per model.

Prompting GPT-4.1 models
------------------------

GPT models like [`gpt-4.1`](/docs/models/gpt-4.1) benefit from precise instructions that explicitly provide the logic and data required to complete the task in the prompt. GPT-4.1 in particular is highly steerable and responsive to well-specified prompts. To get the most out of GPT-4.1, refer to the prompting guide in the cookbook.

#### GPT-4.1 prompting best practices

While the [cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide) has the best and most comprehensive guidance for prompting this model, here are a few best practices to keep in mind.

Building agentic workflows

### System Prompt Reminders

In order to best utilize the agentic capabilities of GPT-4.1, we recommend including three key types of reminders in all agent prompts for persistence, tool calling, and planning. As a whole, we find that these three instructions transform the model's behavior from chatbot-like into a much more "eager" agent, driving the interaction forward autonomously and independently. Here are a few examples:

```text
## PERSISTENCE
You are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely
resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only
terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.

## TOOL CALLING
If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to
the user's request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant
information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.

## PLANNING
You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect
extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this
entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your
ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.
```

#### Tool Calls

Compared to previous models, GPT-4.1 has undergone more training on effectively utilizing tools passed as arguments in an OpenAI API request. We encourage developers to exclusively use the tools field of API requests to pass tools for best understanding and performance, rather than manually injecting tool descriptions into the system prompt and writing a separate parser for tool calls, as some have reported doing in the past.

#### Diff Generation

Correct diffs are critical for coding applications, so we've significantly improved performance at this task for GPT-4.1. In our cookbook, we open-source a recommended diff format on which GPT-4.1 has been extensively trained. That said, the model should generalize to any well-specified format.

Using long context

GPT-4.1 has a performant 1M token input context window, and will be useful for a variety of long context tasks, including structured document parsing, re-ranking, selecting relevant information while ignoring irrelevant context, and performing multi-hop reasoning using context.

#### Optimal Context Size

We show perfect performance at needle-in-a-haystack evals up to our full context size, and we've observed very strong performance at complex tasks with a mix of relevant and irrelevant code and documents in the range of hundreds of thousands of tokens.

#### Delimiters

We tested a variety of delimiters for separating context provided to the model against our long context evals. Briefly, XML and the format demonstrated by Lee et al. ([ref](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13121)) tend to perform well, while JSON performed worse for this task. See our cookbook for prompt examples.

#### Prompt Organization

Especially in long context usage, placement of instructions and context can substantially impact performance. In our experiments, we found that it was optimal to put critical instructions, including the user query, at both the top and the bottom of the prompt; this elicited marginally better performance from the model than putting them only at the top, and much better performance than only at the bottom.

Prompting for chain of thought

As mentioned above, GPT-4.1 isn't a reasoning model, but prompting the model to think step by step (called "chain of thought") can be an effective way for a model to break down problems into more manageable pieces. The model has been trained to perform well at agentic reasoning and real-world problem solving, so it shouldn't require much prompting to do well.

We recommend starting with this basic chain-of-thought instruction at the end of your prompt:

```text
First, think carefully step by step about what documents are needed to answer the query. Then, print out the TITLE and ID of each document. Then, format the IDs into a list.
```

From there, you should improve your CoT prompt by auditing failures in your particular examples and evals, and addressing systematic planning and reasoning errors with more explicit instructions. See our cookbook for a prompt example demonstrating a more opinionated reasoning strategy.

Instruction following

GPT-4.1 exhibits outstanding instruction-following performance, which developers can leverage to precisely shape and control the outputs for their particular use cases. However, since the model follows instructions more literally than its predecessors, may need to provide more explicit specification around what to do or not do, and existing prompts optimized for other models may not immediately work with this model.

#### Recommended Workflow

Here is our recommended workflow for developing and debugging instructions in prompts:

*   Start with an overall "Response Rules" or "Instructions" section with high-level guidance and bullet points.
*   If you'd like to change a more specific behavior, add a section containing more details for that category, like `## Sample Phrases`.
*   If there are specific steps you'd like the model to follow in its workflow, add an ordered list and instruct the model to follow these steps.
*   If behavior still isn't working as expected, check for conflicting, underspecified, or incorrect instructions and examples. If there are conflicting instructions, GPT-4.1 tends to follow the one closer to the end of the prompt.
*   Add examples that demonstrate desired behavior; ensure that any important behavior demonstrated in your examples are also cited in your rules.
*   It's generally not necessary to use all-caps or other incentives like bribes or tips, but developers can experiment with this for extra emphasis if so desired.

#### Common Failure Modes

These failure modes are not unique to GPT-4.1, but we share them here for general awareness and ease of debugging.

*   Instructing a model to always follow a specific behavior can occasionally induce adverse effects. For instance, if told "you must call a tool before responding to the user," models may hallucinate tool inputs or call the tool with null values if they do not have enough information. Adding "if you don't have enough information to call the tool, ask the user for the information you need" should mitigate this.
*   When provided sample phrases, models can use those quotes verbatim and start to sound repetitive to users. Ensure you instruct the model to vary them as necessary.
*   Without specific instructions, some models can be eager to provide additional prose to explain their decisions, or output more formatting in responses than may be desired. Provide instructions and potentially examples to help mitigate.

See our cookbook for an example customer service prompt that demonstrates these principles.

Prompting reasoning models
--------------------------

There are some differences to consider when prompting a [reasoning model](/docs/guides/reasoning) versus prompting a GPT model. Generally speaking, reasoning models will provide better results on tasks with only high-level guidance. This differs from GPT models, which benefit from very precise instructions.

You could think about the difference between reasoning and GPT models like this.

*   A reasoning model is like a senior co-worker. You can give them a goal to achieve and trust them to work out the details.
*   A GPT model is like a junior coworker. They'll perform best with explicit instructions to create a specific output.

For more information on best practices when using reasoning models, [refer to this guide](/docs/guides/reasoning-best-practices).

### A tour of image-related use cases

Recent language models can process image inputs and analyze them — a capability known as **vision**. With `gpt-image-1`, they can both analyze visual inputs and create images.

The OpenAI API offers several endpoints to process images as input or generate them as output, enabling you to build powerful multimodal applications.

|API|Supported use cases|
|---|---|
|Responses API|Analyze images and use them as input and/or generate images as output|
|Images API|Generate images as output, optionally using images as input|
|Chat Completions API|Analyze images and use them as input to generate text or audio|

To learn more about the input and output modalities supported by our models, refer to our [models page](/docs/models).

Generate or edit images
-----------------------

You can generate or edit images using the Image API or the Responses API.

Our latest image generation model, `gpt-image-1`, is a natively multimodal large language model. It can understand text and images and leverage its broad world knowledge to generate images with better instruction following and contextual awareness.

In contrast, we also offer specialized image generation models - DALL·E 2 and 3 - which don't have the same inherent understanding of the world as GPT Image.

Generate images with Responses

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

### Using world knowledge for image generation

The difference between DALL·E models and GPT Image is that a natively multimodal language model can use its visual understanding of the world to generate lifelike images including real-life details without a reference.

For example, if you prompt GPT Image to generate an image of a glass cabinet with the most popular semi-precious stones, the model knows enough to select gemstones like amethyst, rose quartz, jade, etc, and depict them in a realistic way.

Analyze images
--------------

**Vision** is the ability for a model to "see" and understand images. If there is text in an image, the model can also understand the text. It can understand most visual elements, including objects, shapes, colors, and textures, even if there are some [limitations](#limitations).

### Giving a model images as input

You can provide images as input to generation requests in multiple ways:

*   By providing a fully qualified URL to an image file
*   By providing an image as a Base64-encoded data URL
*   By providing a file ID (created with the [Files API](/docs/api-reference/files))

You can provide multiple images as input in a single request by including multiple images in the `content` array, but keep in mind that [images count as tokens](#calculating-costs) and will be billed accordingly.

Passing a URL

Analyze the content of an image

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({

                },
            ],
        }
    ],

Passing a file ID

Analyze the content of an image

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import fs from "fs";

const openai = new OpenAI();

// Function to create a file with the Files API
async function createFile(filePath) {
  const fileContent = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
  const result = await openai.files.create({
    file: fileContent,
    purpose: "vision",
  });
  return result.id;
}

// Getting the file ID
const fileId = await createFile("path_to_your_image.jpg");

const response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
  input: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: [
        { type: "input_text", text: "what's in this image?" },
        {
          type: "input_image",
          file_id: fileId,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Function to create a file with the Files API
def create_file(file_path):
  with open(file_path, "rb") as file_content:
    result = client.files.create(
        file=file_content,
        purpose="vision",
    )
    return result.id

# Getting the file ID
file_id = create_file("path_to_your_image.jpg")

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    input=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "input_text", "text": "what's in this image?"},
            {
                "type": "input_image",
                "file_id": file_id,
            },
        ],
    }],
)

print(response.output_text)
```

### Image input requirements

Input images must meet the following requirements to be used in the API.

|Supported file types|PNG (.png)JPEG (.jpeg and .jpg)WEBP (.webp)Non-animated GIF (.gif)|
|Size limits|Up to 50 MB total payload size per requestUp to 500 individual image inputs per request|
|Other requirements|No watermarks or logosNo NSFW contentClear enough for a human to understand|

### Specify image input detail level

The `detail` parameter tells the model what level of detail to use when processing and understanding the image (`low`, `high`, or `auto` to let the model decide). If you skip the parameter, the model will use `auto`.

```plain
{
    "type": "input_image",
    "image_url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg",
    "detail": "high"
}
```

You can save tokens and speed up responses by using `"detail": "low"`. This lets the model process the image with a budget of 85 tokens. The model receives a low-resolution 512px x 512px version of the image. This is fine if your use case doesn't require the model to see with high-resolution detail (for example, if you're asking about the dominant shape or color in the image).

On the other hand, you can use `"detail": "high"` if you want the model to have a better understanding of the image.

Read more about calculating image processing costs in the [Calculating costs](#calculating-costs) section below.

Limitations
-----------

While models with vision capabilities are powerful and can be used in many situations, it's important to understand the limitations of these models. Here are some known limitations:

*   **Medical images**: The model is not suitable for interpreting specialized medical images like CT scans and shouldn't be used for medical advice.
*   **Non-English**: The model may not perform optimally when handling images with text of non-Latin alphabets, such as Japanese or Korean.
*   **Small text**: Enlarge text within the image to improve readability, but avoid cropping important details.
*   **Rotation**: The model may misinterpret rotated or upside-down text and images.
*   **Visual elements**: The model may struggle to understand graphs or text where colors or styles—like solid, dashed, or dotted lines—vary.
*   **Spatial reasoning**: The model struggles with tasks requiring precise spatial localization, such as identifying chess positions.
*   **Accuracy**: The model may generate incorrect descriptions or captions in certain scenarios.
*   **Image shape**: The model struggles with panoramic and fisheye images.
*   **Metadata and resizing**: The model doesn't process original file names or metadata, and images are resized before analysis, affecting their original dimensions.
*   **Counting**: The model may give approximate counts for objects in images.
*   **CAPTCHAS**: For safety reasons, our system blocks the submission of CAPTCHAs.

Calculating costs
-----------------

Image inputs are metered and charged in tokens, just as text inputs are. How images are converted to text token inputs varies based on the model. You can find a vision pricing calculator in the FAQ section of the [pricing page](https://openai.com/api/pricing/).

### GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-4.1-nano, o4-mini

Image inputs are metered and charged in tokens based on their dimensions. The token cost of an image is determined as follows:

A. Calculate the number of 32px x 32px patches that are needed to fully cover the image (a patch may extend beyond the image boundaries; out-of-bounds pixels are treated as black.)

```text
raw_patches = ceil(width/32)×ceil(height/32)
```

B. If the number of patches exceeds 1536, we scale down the image so that it can be covered by no more than 1536 patches

```text
r = √(32²×1536/(width×height))
r = r × min( floor(width×r/32) / (width×r/32), floor(height×r/32) / (height×r/32) )
```

C. The token cost is the number of patches, capped at a maximum of 1536 tokens

```text
image_tokens = ceil(resized_width/32)×ceil(resized_height/32)
```

D. For `gpt-4.1-mini` we multiply image tokens by 1.62 to get total tokens, for `gpt-4.1-nano` we multiply image tokens by 2.46 to get total tokens, and for `o4-mini` we multiply image tokens by 1.72 to get total tokens, that are then billed at normal text token rates.

Note:

**Cost calculation examples**

*   A 1024 x 1024 image is **1024 tokens**
    *   Width is 1024, resulting in `(1024 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 32` patches
    *   Height is 1024, resulting in `(1024 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 32` patches
    *   Tokens calculated as `32 * 32 = 1024`, below the cap of 1536
*   A 1800 x 2400 image is **1452 tokens**
    *   Width is 1800, resulting in `(1800 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 57` patches
    *   Height is 2400, resulting in `(2400 + 32 - 1) // 32 = 75` patches
    *   We need `57 * 75 = 4275` patches to cover the full image. Since that exceeds 1536, we need to scale down the image while preserving the aspect ratio.
    *   We can calculate the shrink factor as `sqrt(token_budget × patch_size^2 / (width * height))`. In our example, the shrink factor is `sqrt(1536 * 32^2 / (1800 * 2400)) = 0.603`.
    *   Width is now 1086, resulting in `1086 / 32 = 33.94` patches
    *   Height is now 1448, resulting in `1448 / 32 = 45.25` patches
    *   We want to make sure the image fits in a whole number of patches. In this case we scale again by `33 / 33.94 = 0.97` to fit the width in 33 patches.
    *   The final width is then `1086 * (33 / 33.94) = 1056)` and the final height is `1448 * (33 / 33.94) = 1408`
    *   The image now requires `1056 / 32 = 33` patches to cover the width and `1408 / 32 = 44` patches to cover the height
    *   The total number of tokens is the `33 * 44 = 1452`, below the cap of 1536

### GPT 4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o-mini, CUA, and o-series (except o4-mini)

The token cost of an image is determined by two factors: size and detail.

Any image with `"detail": "low"` costs a set, base number of tokens. This amount varies by model (see charte below). To calculate the cost of an image with `"detail": "high"`, we do the following:

*   Scale to fit in a 2048px x 2048px square, maintaining original aspect ratio
*   Scale so that the image's shortest side is 768px long
*   Count the number of 512px squares in the image—each square costs a set amount of tokens (see chart below)
*   Add the base tokens to the total

|Model|Base tokens|Tile tokens|
|---|---|---|
|4o, 4.1, 4.5|85|170|
|4o-mini|2833|5667|
|o1, o1-pro, o3|75|150|
|computer-use-preview|65|129|

**Cost calculation examples (for gpt-4o)**

*   A 1024 x 1024 square image in `"detail": "high"` mode costs 765 tokens
    *   1024 is less than 2048, so there is no initial resize.
    *   The shortest side is 1024, so we scale the image down to 768 x 768.
    *   4 512px square tiles are needed to represent the image, so the final token cost is `170 * 4 + 85 = 765`.
*   A 2048 x 4096 image in `"detail": "high"` mode costs 1105 tokens
    *   We scale down the image to 1024 x 2048 to fit within the 2048 square.
    *   The shortest side is 1024, so we further scale down to 768 x 1536.
    *   6 512px tiles are needed, so the final token cost is `170 * 6 + 85 = 1105`.
*   A 4096 x 8192 image in `"detail": "low"` most costs 85 tokens
    *   Regardless of input size, low detail images are a fixed cost.

### GPT Image 1

For GPT Image 1, we calculate the cost of an image input the same way as described above, except that we scale down the image so that the shortest side is 512px instead of 768px. The price depends on the dimensions of the image and the [input fidelity](/docs/guides/image-generation?image-generation-model=gpt-image-1#input-fidelity).

When input fidelity is set to low, the base cost is 65 image tokens, and each tile costs 129 image tokens. When using high input fidelity, we add a set number of tokens based on the image's aspect ratio in addition to the image tokens described above.

*   If your image is square, we add 4096 extra input image tokens.
*   If it is closer to portrait or landscape, we add 6144 extra tokens.

To see pricing for image input tokens, refer to our [pricing page](/docs/pricing#latest-models).

* * *

We process images at the token level, so each image we process counts towards your tokens per minute (TPM) limit.

Structured Outputs
==================

Ensure responses adhere to a JSON schema.

Try it out
----------

Try it out in the [Playground](/playground) or generate a ready-to-use schema definition to experiment with structured outputs.

Generate

Introduction
------------

JSON is one of the most widely used formats in the world for applications to exchange data.

Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/overview/what-is-jsonschema), so you don't need to worry about the model omitting a required key, or hallucinating an invalid enum value.

Some benefits of Structured Outputs include:

1.  **Reliable type-safety:** No need to validate or retry incorrectly formatted responses
2.  **Explicit refusals:** Safety-based model refusals are now programmatically detectable
3.  **Simpler prompting:** No need for strongly worded prompts to achieve consistent formatting

In addition to supporting JSON Schema in the REST API, the OpenAI SDKs for [Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#structured-outputs-parsing-helpers) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/blob/master/helpers.md#structured-outputs-parsing-helpers) also make it easy to define object schemas using [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) respectively. Below, you can see how to extract information from unstructured text that conforms to a schema defined in code.

Getting a structured response

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const CalendarEvent = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  date: z.string(),
  participants: z.array(z.string()),
});

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  input: [
    { role: "system", content: "Extract the event information." },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday.",
    },
  ],
  text: {
    format: zodTextFormat(CalendarEvent, "event"),
  },
});

const event = response.output_parsed;
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = OpenAI()

class CalendarEvent(BaseModel):
    name: str
    date: str
    participants: list[str]

response = client.responses.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract the event information."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Alice and Bob are going to a science fair on Friday.",
        },
    ],
    text_format=CalendarEvent,
)

event = response.output_parsed
```

### Supported models

Structured Outputs is available in our [latest large language models](/docs/models), starting with GPT-4o. Older models like `gpt-4-turbo` and earlier may use [JSON mode](#json-mode) instead.

When to use Structured Outputs via function calling vs via text.format
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Structured Outputs is available in two forms in the OpenAI API:

1.  When using [function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling)
2.  When using a `json_schema` response format

Function calling is useful when you are building an application that bridges the models and functionality of your application.

For example, you can give the model access to functions that query a database in order to build an AI assistant that can help users with their orders, or functions that can interact with the UI.

Conversely, Structured Outputs via `response_format` are more suitable when you want to indicate a structured schema for use when the model responds to the user, rather than when the model calls a tool.

For example, if you are building a math tutoring application, you might want the assistant to respond to your user using a specific JSON Schema so that you can generate a UI that displays different parts of the model's output in distinct ways.

Put simply:

*   If you are connecting the model to tools, functions, data, etc. in your system, then you should use function calling
*   If you want to structure the model's output when it responds to the user, then you should use a structured `text.format`

The remainder of this guide will focus on non-function calling use cases in the Responses API. To learn more about how to use Structured Outputs with function calling, check out the [Function Calling](/docs/guides/function-calling#function-calling-with-structured-outputs) guide.

### Structured Outputs vs JSON mode

Structured Outputs is the evolution of [JSON mode](#json-mode). While both ensure valid JSON is produced, only Structured Outputs ensure schema adherance. Both Structured Outputs and JSON mode are supported in the Responses API,Chat Completions API, Assistants API, Fine-tuning API and Batch API.

We recommend always using Structured Outputs instead of JSON mode when possible.

However, Structured Outputs with `response_format: {type: "json_schema", ...}` is only supported with the `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`, and `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` model snapshots and later.

||Structured Outputs|JSON Mode|
|---|---|---|
|Outputs valid JSON|Yes|Yes|
|Adheres to schema|Yes (see supported schemas)|No|
|Compatible models|gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o-2024-08-06, and later|gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4-* and gpt-4o-* models|
|Enabling|text: { format: { type: "json_schema", "strict": true, "schema": ... } }|text: { format: { type: "json_object" } }|

Examples
--------

Chain of thought

### Chain of thought

You can ask the model to output an answer in a structured, step-by-step way, to guide the user through the solution.

Structured Outputs for chain-of-thought math tutoring

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const Step = z.object({
  explanation: z.string(),
  output: z.string(),
});

const MathReasoning = z.object({
  steps: z.array(Step),
  final_answer: z.string(),
});

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  input: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content:
        "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
    },
    { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" },
  ],
  text: {
    format: zodTextFormat(MathReasoning, "math_reasoning"),
  },
});

const math_reasoning = response.output_parsed;
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = OpenAI()

class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str

response = client.responses.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
        },
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"},
    ],
    text_format=MathReasoning,

Structured data extraction

### Structured data extraction

You can define structured fields to extract from unstructured input data, such as research papers.

Extracting data from research papers using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const ResearchPaperExtraction = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  authors: z.array(z.string()),
  abstract: z.string(),
  keywords: z.array(z.string()),
});

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  input: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content:
        "You are an expert at structured data extraction. You will be given unstructured text from a research paper and should convert it into the given structure.",
    },
    { role: "user", content: "..." },
  ],
  text: {
    format: zodTextFormat(ResearchPaperExtraction, "research_paper_extraction"),
  },
});

const research_paper = response.output_parsed;
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = OpenAI()

class ResearchPaperExtraction(BaseModel):
    title: str
    authors: list[str]
    abstract: str
    keywords: list[str]

response = client.responses.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are an expert at structured data extraction. You will be given unstructured text from a research paper and should convert it into the given structure.",
        },
        {"role": "user", "content": "..."},
    ],
    text_format=ResearchPaperExtraction,
)

research_paper = response.output_parsed

UI generation

### UI Generation

You can generate valid HTML by representing it as recursive data structures with constraints, like enums.

Generating HTML using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const UI = z.lazy(() =>
  z.object({
    type: z.enum(["div", "button", "header", "section", "field", "form"]),
    label: z.string(),
    children: z.array(UI),
    attributes: z.array(
      z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        value: z.string(),
      })
    ),
  })
);

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  input: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a UI generator AI. Convert the user input into a UI.",
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Make a User Profile Form",
    },
  ],
  text: {
    format: zodTextFormat(UI, "ui"),
  },
});

const ui = response.output_parsed;
```

```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import List

from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

client = OpenAI()

class UIType(str, Enum):
    div = "div"
    button = "button"
    header = "header"
    section = "section"
    field = "field"
    form = "form"

class Attribute(BaseModel):
    name: str
    value: str

class UI(BaseModel):
    type: UIType
    label: str
    children: List["UI"]
    attributes: List[Attribute]

UI.model_rebuild()  # This is required to enable recursive types

class Response(BaseModel):
    ui: UI

response = client.responses.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",

Moderation

### Moderation

You can classify inputs on multiple categories, which is a common way of doing moderation.

Moderation using Structured Outputs

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const ContentCompliance = z.object({
  is_violating: z.boolean(),
  category: z.enum(["violence", "sexual", "self_harm"]).nullable(),
  explanation_if_violating: z.string().nullable(),
});

const response = await openai.responses.parse({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input: [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Determine if the user input violates specific guidelines and explain if they do."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "How do I prepare for a job interview?"
      }
    ],
    text: {
        format: zodTextFormat(ContentCompliance, "content_compliance"),
    },
});

const compliance = response.output_parsed;

How to use Structured Outputs with text.format
----------------------------------------------

Step 1: Define your schema

First you must design the JSON Schema that the model should be constrained to follow. See the [examples](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#examples) at the top of this guide for reference.

While Structured Outputs supports much of JSON Schema, some features are unavailable either for performance or technical reasons. See [here](/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas) for more details.

#### Tips for your JSON Schema

To maximize the quality of model generations, we recommend the following:

*   Name keys clearly and intuitively
*   Create clear titles and descriptions for important keys in your structure
*   Create and use evals to determine the structure that works best for your use case

Step 2: Supply your schema in the API call

To use Structured Outputs, simply specify

```json
text: { format: { type: "json_schema", "strict": true, "schema": … } }
```

For example:

```python
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    text={
        "format": {
            "type": "json_schema",
            "name": "math_response",
            "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "steps": {
                        "type": "array",
                        "items": {
                            "type": "object",
                            "properties": {
                                "explanation": {"type": "string"},
                                "output": {"type": "string"}
                            },
                            "required": ["explanation", "output"],
                            "additionalProperties": False
                        }
                    },
                    "final_answer": {"type": "string"}
                },
                "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
                "additionalProperties": False
            },
            "strict": True
        }
    }
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```javascript
const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },
        { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" }
    ],
    text: {
        format: {
            type: "json_schema",
            name: "math_response",

                                explanation: { type: "string" },
                                output: { type: "string" }
                            },
                            required: ["explanation", "output"],
                            additionalProperties: false
                        }
                    },
                    final_answer: { type: "string" }
                },
                required: ["steps", "final_answer"],
                additionalProperties: false
            },
            strict: true
        }
    }
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",

      {

      },
      {

      }
    ],
    "text": {
      "format": {
        "type": "json_schema",
        "name": "math_response",
        "schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {

                "additionalProperties": false
              }
            },
            "final_answer": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        },
        "strict": true
      }
    }
  }'
```

**Note:** the first request you make with any schema will have additional latency as our API processes the schema, but subsequent requests with the same schema will not have additional latency.

Step 3: Handle edge cases

In some cases, the model might not generate a valid response that matches the provided JSON schema.

This can happen in the case of a refusal, if the model refuses to answer for safety reasons, or if for example you reach a max tokens limit and the response is incomplete.

```javascript
try {
  const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    input: [{
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"
      },
    ],
    max_output_tokens: 50,
    text: {
      format: {
        type: "json_schema",
        name: "math_response",
        schema: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            steps: {
              type: "array",
              items: {
                type: "object",
                properties: {
                  explanation: {
                    type: "string"
                  },
                  output: {
                    type: "string"
                  },
                },
                required: ["explanation", "output"],
                additionalProperties: false,
              },
            },
            final_answer: {
              type: "string"
            },
          },
          required: ["steps", "final_answer"],
          additionalProperties: false,
        },
        strict: true,
      },
    }
  });

  if (response.status === "incomplete" && response.incomplete_details.reason === "max_output_tokens") {
    // Handle the case where the model did not return a complete response
    throw new Error("Incomplete response");
  }

  const math_response = response.output[0].content[0];

  if (math_response.type === "refusal") {
    // handle refusal
    console.log(math_response.refusal);
  } else if (math_response.type === "output_text") {
    console.log(math_response.text);
  } else {
    throw new Error("No response content");
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Handle edge cases
  console.error(e);
}
```

```python
try:
    response = client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
        input=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step.",
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"},
        ],
        text={
            "format": {
                "type": "json_schema",
                "name": "math_response",
                "strict": True,
                "schema": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "steps": {
                            "type": "array",
                            "items": {
                                "type": "object",
                                "properties": {
                                    "explanation": {"type": "string"},
                                    "output": {"type": "string"},
                                },
                                "required": ["explanation", "output"],
                                "additionalProperties": False,
                            },
                        },
                        "final_answer": {"type": "string"},
                    },
                    "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
                    "additionalProperties": False,
                },
                "strict": True,
            },
        },
    )
except Exception as e:
    # handle errors like finish_reason, refusal, content_filter, etc.
    pass
```

### Refusals with Structured Outputs

When using Structured Outputs with user-generated input, OpenAI models may occasionally refuse to fulfill the request for safety reasons. Since a refusal does not necessarily follow the schema you have supplied in `response_format`, the API response will include a new field called `refusal` to indicate that the model refused to fulfill the request.

When the `refusal` property appears in your output object, you might present the refusal in your UI, or include conditional logic in code that consumes the response to handle the case of a refused request.

```python
class Step(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    output: str

class MathReasoning(BaseModel):
    steps: list[Step]
    final_answer: str

completion = client.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23"}
    ],
    response_format=MathReasoning,
)

math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message

# If the model refuses to respond, you will get a refusal message
if (math_reasoning.refusal):
    print(math_reasoning.refusal)
else:
    print(math_reasoning.parsed)
```

```javascript
const Step = z.object({
  explanation: z.string(),
  output: z.string(),
});

const MathReasoning = z.object({
  steps: z.array(Step),
  final_answer: z.string(),
});

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.parse({
  model: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful math tutor. Guide the user through the solution step by step." },
    { role: "user", content: "how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23" },
  ],
  response_format: zodResponseFormat(MathReasoning, "math_reasoning"),
});

const math_reasoning = completion.choices[0].message

// If the model refuses to respond, you will get a refusal message
if (math_reasoning.refusal) {
  console.log(math_reasoning.refusal);
} else {
  console.log(math_reasoning.parsed);
}
```

The API response from a refusal will look something like this:

```json
{
  "id": "resp_1234567890",
  "object": "response",
  "created_at": 1721596428,
  "status": "completed",
  "error": null,
  "incomplete_details": null,
  "input": [],
  "instructions": null,
  "max_output_tokens": null,
  "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
  "output": [{
    "id": "msg_1234567890",
    "type": "message",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "refusal",
        "refusal": "I'm sorry, I cannot assist with that request."
      }
    ]
  }],
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 81,
    "output_tokens": 11,
    "total_tokens": 92,
    "output_tokens_details": {
      "reasoning_tokens": 0,
    }
  },
}
```

### Tips and best practices

#### Handling user-generated input

If your application is using user-generated input, make sure your prompt includes instructions on how to handle situations where the input cannot result in a valid response.

The model will always try to adhere to the provided schema, which can result in hallucinations if the input is completely unrelated to the schema.

You could include language in your prompt to specify that you want to return empty parameters, or a specific sentence, if the model detects that the input is incompatible with the task.

#### Handling mistakes

Structured Outputs can still contain mistakes. If you see mistakes, try adjusting your instructions, providing examples in the system instructions, or splitting tasks into simpler subtasks. Refer to the [prompt engineering guide](/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) for more guidance on how to tweak your inputs.

#### Avoid JSON schema divergence

To prevent your JSON Schema and corresponding types in your programming language from diverging, we strongly recommend using the native Pydantic/zod sdk support.

If you prefer to specify the JSON schema directly, you could add CI rules that flag when either the JSON schema or underlying data objects are edited, or add a CI step that auto-generates the JSON Schema from type definitions (or vice-versa).

Streaming
---------

You can use streaming to process model responses or function call arguments as they are being generated, and parse them as structured data.

That way, you don't have to wait for the entire response to complete before handling it. This is particularly useful if you would like to display JSON fields one by one, or handle function call arguments as soon as they are available.

We recommend relying on the SDKs to handle streaming with Structured Outputs.

```python
from typing import List

from openai import OpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel

class EntitiesModel(BaseModel):
    attributes: List[str]
    colors: List[str]
    animals: List[str]

client = OpenAI()

with client.responses.stream(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Extract entities from the input text"},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog with piercing blue eyes",
        },
    ],
    text_format=EntitiesModel,
) as stream:
    for event in stream:
        if event.type == "response.refusal.delta":
            print(event.delta, end="")
        elif event.type == "response.output_text.delta":
            print(event.delta, end="")
        elif event.type == "response.error":
            print(event.error, end="")
        elif event.type == "response.completed":
            print("Completed")
            # print(event.response.output)

    final_response = stream.get_final_response()
    print(final_response)
```

```javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { zodTextFormat } from "openai/helpers/zod";
import { z } from "zod";

const EntitiesSchema = z.object({
  attributes: z.array(z.string()),
  colors: z.array(z.string()),
  animals: z.array(z.string()),
});

const openai = new OpenAI();
const stream = openai.responses
  .stream({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: [
      { role: "user", content: "What's the weather like in Paris today?" },
    ],
    text: {
      format: zodTextFormat(EntitiesSchema, "entities"),
    },
  })
  .on("response.refusal.delta", (event) => {
    process.stdout.write(event.delta);
  })
  .on("response.output_text.delta", (event) => {
    process.stdout.write(event.delta);
  })
  .on("response.output_text.done", () => {
    process.stdout.write("\n");
  })
  .on("response.error", (event) => {
    console.error(event.error);
  });

const result = await stream.finalResponse();

console.log(result);
```

Supported schemas
-----------------

Structured Outputs supports a subset of the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/docs) language.

#### Supported types

The following types are supported for Structured Outputs:

*   String
*   Number
*   Boolean
*   Integer
*   Object
*   Array
*   Enum
*   anyOf

#### Supported properties

In addition to specifying the type of a property, you can specify a selection of additional constraints:

**Supported `string` properties:**

*   `pattern` — A regular expression that the string must match.
*   `format` — Predefined formats for strings. Currently supported:
    *   `date-time`
    *   `time`
    *   `date`
    *   `duration`
    *   `email`
    *   `hostname`
    *   `ipv4`
    *   `ipv6`
    *   `uuid`

**Supported `number` properties:**

*   `multipleOf` — The number must be a multiple of this value.
*   `maximum` — The number must be less than or equal to this value.
*   `exclusiveMaximum` — The number must be less than this value.
*   `minimum` — The number must be greater than or equal to this value.
*   `exclusiveMinimum` — The number must be greater than this value.

**Supported `array` properties:**

*   `minItems` — The array must have at least this many items.
*   `maxItems` — The array must have at most this many items.

Here are some examples on how you can use these type restrictions:

String Restrictions

```json
{
    "name": "user_data",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "name": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The name of the user"
            },
            "username": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The username of the user. Must start with @",
                "pattern": "^@[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"
            },
            "email": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The email of the user",
                "format": "email"
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "name", "username", "email"
        ]
    }
}
```

Number Restrictions

```json
{
    "name": "weather_data",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": ["string", "null"],
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            },
            "value": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "The actual temperature value in the location",
                "minimum": -130,
                "maximum": 130
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit", "value"
        ]
    }
}
```

Note these constraints are [not yet supported for fine-tuned models](#some-type-specific-keywords-are-not-yet-supported).

#### Root objects must not be `anyOf` and must be an object

Note that the root level object of a schema must be an object, and not use `anyOf`. A pattern that appears in Zod (as one example) is using a discriminated union, which produces an `anyOf` at the top level. So code such as the following won't work:

```javascript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { zodResponseFormat } from 'openai/helpers/zod';

const BaseResponseSchema = z.object({/* ... */});
const UnsuccessfulResponseSchema = z.object({/* ... */});

const finalSchema = z.discriminatedUnion('status', [
BaseResponseSchema,
UnsuccessfulResponseSchema,
]);

// Invalid JSON Schema for Structured Outputs
const json = zodResponseFormat(finalSchema, 'final_schema');
```

#### All fields must be `required`

To use Structured Outputs, all fields or function parameters must be specified as `required`.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": ["location", "unit"]
    }
}
```

Although all fields must be required (and the model will return a value for each parameter), it is possible to emulate an optional parameter by using a union type with `null`.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": ["string", "null"],
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Objects have limitations on nesting depth and size

A schema may have up to 5000 object properties total, with up to 5 levels of nesting.

#### Limitations on total string size

In a schema, total string length of all property names, definition names, enum values, and const values cannot exceed 120,000 characters.

#### Limitations on enum size

A schema may have up to 1000 enum values across all enum properties.

For a single enum property with string values, the total string length of all enum values cannot exceed 15,000 characters when there are more than 250 enum values.

#### `additionalProperties: false` must always be set in objects

`additionalProperties` controls whether it is allowable for an object to contain additional keys / values that were not defined in the JSON Schema.

Structured Outputs only supports generating specified keys / values, so we require developers to set `additionalProperties: false` to opt into Structured Outputs.

```json
{
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Fetches the weather in the given location",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The location to get the weather for"
            },
            "unit": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The unit to return the temperature in",
                "enum": ["F", "C"]
            }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "required": [
            "location", "unit"
        ]
    }

```

#### Key ordering

When using Structured Outputs, outputs will be produced in the same order as the ordering of keys in the schema.

#### Some type-specific keywords are not yet supported

*   **Composition:** `allOf`, `not`, `dependentRequired`, `dependentSchemas`, `if`, `then`, `else`

For fine-tuned models, we additionally do not support the following:

*   **For strings:** `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, `format`
*   **For numbers:** `minimum`, `maximum`, `multipleOf`
*   **For objects:** `patternProperties`
*   **For arrays:** `minItems`, `maxItems`

If you turn on Structured Outputs by supplying `strict: true` and call the API with an unsupported JSON Schema, you will receive an error.

#### For `anyOf`, the nested schemas must each be a valid JSON Schema per this subset

Here's an example supported anyOf schema:

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "item": {
            "anyOf": [
                {
                    "type": "object",
                    "description": "The user object to insert into the database",
                    "properties": {
                        "name": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The name of the user"
                        },
                        "age": {
                            "type": "number",
                            "description": "The age of the user"
                        }
                    },
                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "required": [
                        "name",
                        "age"
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "type": "object",
                    "description": "The address object to insert into the database",
                    "properties": {
                        "number": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The number of the address. Eg. for 123 main st, this would be 123"
                        },
                        "street": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The street name. Eg. for 123 main st, this would be main st"
                        },
                        "city": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The city of the address"
                        }
                    },
                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "required": [
                        "number",
                        "street",
                        "city"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": [
        "item"
    ]
}
```

#### Definitions are supported

You can use definitions to define subschemas which are referenced throughout your schema. The following is a simple example.

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "steps": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "$ref": "#/$defs/step"
            }
        },
        "final_answer": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "$defs": {
        "step": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "explanation": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "output": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "explanation",
                "output"
            ],
            "additionalProperties": false
        }
    },
    "required": [
        "steps",
        "final_answer"
    ],
    "additionalProperties": false
}
```

#### Recursive schemas are supported

Sample recursive schema using `#` to indicate root recursion.

```json
{
    "name": "ui",
    "description": "Dynamically generated UI",
    "strict": true,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "type": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The type of the UI component",
                "enum": ["div", "button", "header", "section", "field", "form"]
            },
            "label": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The label of the UI component, used for buttons or form fields"
            },
            "children": {
                "type": "array",
                "description": "Nested UI components",
                "items": {
                    "$ref": "#"
                }
            },
            "attributes": {
                "type": "array",

                    "properties": {
                        "name": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The name of the attribute, for example onClick or className"
                        },
                        "value": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The value of the attribute"
                        }
                    },
                    "additionalProperties": false,
                    "required": ["name", "value"]
                }
            }
        },
        "required": ["type", "label", "children", "attributes"],
        "additionalProperties": false
    }
}
```

Sample recursive schema using explicit recursion:

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "linked_list": {
            "$ref": "#/$defs/linked_list_node"
        }
    },
    "$defs": {
        "linked_list_node": {

                },
                "next": {
                    "anyOf": [
                        {
                            "$ref": "#/$defs/linked_list_node"
                        },
                        {
                            "type": "null"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            "additionalProperties": false,
            "required": [
                "next",
                "value"
            ]
        }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": [
        "linked_list"
    ]
}
```

JSON mode
---------

JSON mode is a more basic version of the Structured Outputs feature. While JSON mode ensures that model output is valid JSON, Structured Outputs reliably matches the model's output to the schema you specify. We recommend you use Structured Outputs if it is supported for your use case.

When JSON mode is turned on, the model's output is ensured to be valid JSON, except for in some edge cases that you should detect and handle appropriately.

To turn on JSON mode with the Responses API you can set the `text.format` to `{ "type": "json_object" }`. If you are using function calling, JSON mode is always turned on.

Important notes:

*   When using JSON mode, you must always instruct the model to produce JSON via some message in the conversation, for example via your system message. If you don't include an explicit instruction to generate JSON, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace and the request may run continually until it reaches the token limit. To help ensure you don't forget, the API will throw an error if the string "JSON" does not appear somewhere in the context.
*   JSON mode will not guarantee the output matches any specific schema, only that it is valid and parses without errors. You should use Structured Outputs to ensure it matches your schema, or if that is not possible, you should use a validation library and potentially retries to ensure that the output matches your desired schema.
*   Your application must detect and handle the edge cases that can result in the model output not being a complete JSON object (see below)

Handling edge cases

```javascript
const we_did_not_specify_stop_tokens = true;

try {
  const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125",
    input: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful assistant designed to output JSON.",
      },
      { role: "user", content: "Who won the world series in 2020? Please respond in the format {winner: ...}" },
    ],
    text: { format: { type: "json_object" } },
  });

  // Check if the conversation was too long for the context window, resulting in incomplete JSON 
  if (response.status === "incomplete" && response.incomplete_details.reason === "max_output_tokens") {
    // your code should handle this error case
  }

  // Check if the OpenAI safety system refused the request and generated a refusal instead
  if (response.output[0].content[0].type === "refusal") {
    // your code should handle this error case
    // In this case, the .content field will contain the explanation (if any) that the model generated for why it is refusing
    console.log(response.output[0].content[0].refusal)
  }

  // Check if the model's output included restricted content, so the generation of JSON was halted and may be partial
  if (response.status === "incomplete" && response.incomplete_details.reason === "content_filter") {
    // your code should handle this error case
  }

  if (response.status === "completed") {
    // In this case the model has either successfully finished generating the JSON object according to your schema, or the model generated one of the tokens you provided as a "stop token"

    if (we_did_not_specify_stop_tokens) {
      // If you didn't specify any stop tokens, then the generation is complete and the content key will contain the serialized JSON object
      // This will parse successfully and should now contain  {"winner": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}
      console.log(JSON.parse(response.output_text))
    } else {
      // Check if the response.output_text ends with one of your stop tokens and handle appropriately
    }
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Your code should handle errors here, for example a network error calling the API
  console.error(e)
}

API specs:


Create a model response
post
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/responses
Creates a model response. Provide text or image inputs to generate text or JSON outputs. Have the model call your own custom code or use built-in tools like web search or file search to use your own data as input for the model's response.

Request body
background
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
Whether to run the model response in the background. Learn more.

include
array or null

Optional
Specify additional output data to include in the model response. Currently supported values are:

code_interpreter_call.outputs: Includes the outputs of python code execution in code interpreter tool call items.
computer_call_output.output.image_url: Include image urls from the computer call output.
file_search_call.results: Include the search results of the file search tool call.
message.input_image.image_url: Include image urls from the input message.
message.output_text.logprobs: Include logprobs with assistant messages.
reasoning.encrypted_content: Includes an encrypted version of reasoning tokens in reasoning item outputs. This enables reasoning items to be used in multi-turn conversations when using the Responses API statelessly (like when the store parameter is set to false, or when an organization is enrolled in the zero data retention program).
input
string or array

Optional
Text, image, or file inputs to the model, used to generate a response.

Learn more:

Text inputs and outputs
Image inputs
File inputs
Conversation state
Function calling

Hide possible types
Text input
string
A text input to the model, equivalent to a text input with the user role.

Input item list
array
A list of one or many input items to the model, containing different content types.


Hide possible types
Input message
object
A message input to the model with a role indicating instruction following hierarchy. Instructions given with the developer or system role take precedence over instructions given with the user role. Messages with the assistant role are presumed to have been generated by the model in previous interactions.


Show properties
Item
object
An item representing part of the context for the response to be generated by the model. Can contain text, images, and audio inputs, as well as previous assistant responses and tool call outputs.


Show possible types
Item reference
object
An internal identifier for an item to reference.


Show properties
instructions
string or null

Optional
A system (or developer) message inserted into the model's context.

When using along with previous_response_id, the instructions from a previous response will not be carried over to the next response. This makes it simple to swap out system (or developer) messages in new responses.

max_output_tokens
integer or null

Optional
An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a response, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.

max_tool_calls
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of total calls to built-in tools that can be processed in a response. This maximum number applies across all built-in tool calls, not per individual tool. Any further attempts to call a tool by the model will be ignored.

metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

model
string

Optional
Model ID used to generate the response, like gpt-4o or o3. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the model guide to browse and compare available models.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to allow the model to run tool calls in parallel.

previous_response_id
string or null

Optional
The unique ID of the previous response to the model. Use this to create multi-turn conversations. Learn more about conversation state.

prompt
object or null

Optional
Reference to a prompt template and its variables. Learn more.


Hide properties
id
string

Required
The unique identifier of the prompt template to use.

variables
map

Optional
Optional map of values to substitute in for variables in your prompt. The substitution values can either be strings, or other Response input types like images or files.

version
string or null

Optional
Optional version of the prompt template.

reasoning
object or null

Optional
o-series models only

Configuration options for reasoning models.


Hide properties
effort
string or null

Optional
Defaults to medium
o-series models only

Constrains effort on reasoning for reasoning models. Currently supported values are low, medium, and high. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response.

generate_summary
Deprecated
string or null

Optional
Deprecated: use summary instead.

A summary of the reasoning performed by the model. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the model's reasoning process. One of auto, concise, or detailed.

summary
string or null

Optional
A summary of the reasoning performed by the model. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the model's reasoning process. One of auto, concise, or detailed.

service_tier
string or null

Optional
Defaults to auto
Specifies the processing type used for serving the request.

If set to 'auto', then the request will be processed with the service tier configured in the Project settings. Unless otherwise configured, the Project will use 'default'.
If set to 'default', then the requset will be processed with the standard pricing and performance for the selected model.
If set to 'flex' or 'priority', then the request will be processed with the corresponding service tier. Contact sales to learn more about Priority processing.
When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.
When the service_tier parameter is set, the response body will include the service_tier value based on the processing mode actually used to serve the request. This response value may be different from the value set in the parameter.

store
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to store the generated model response for later retrieval via API.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using server-sent events. See the Streaming section below for more information.

temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

text
object

Optional
Configuration options for a text response from the model. Can be plain text or structured JSON data. Learn more:

Text inputs and outputs
Structured Outputs

Hide properties
format
object

Optional
An object specifying the format that the model must output.

Configuring { "type": "json_schema" } enables Structured Outputs, which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the Structured Outputs guide.

The default format is { "type": "text" } with no additional options.

Not recommended for gpt-4o and newer models:

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables the older JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using json_schema is preferred for models that support it.


Show possible types
tool_choice
string or object

Optional
How the model should select which tool (or tools) to use when generating a response. See the tools parameter to see how to specify which tools the model can call.


Hide possible types
Tool choice mode
string
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.

none means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message.

auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools.

required means the model must call one or more tools.

Hosted tool
object
Indicates that the model should use a built-in tool to generate a response. Learn more about built-in tools.


Show properties
Function tool
object
Use this option to force the model to call a specific function.


Show properties
MCP tool
object
Use this option to force the model to call a specific tool on a remote MCP server.


Show properties
tools
array

Optional
An array of tools the model may call while generating a response. You can specify which tool to use by setting the tool_choice parameter.

The two categories of tools you can provide the model are:

top_logprobs
integer or null

Optional
An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.

top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

truncation
string or null

Optional
Defaults to disabled
The truncation strategy to use for the model response.

auto: If the context of this response and previous ones exceeds the model's context window size, the model will truncate the response to fit the context window by dropping input items in the middle of the conversation.
disabled (default): If a model response will exceed the context window size for a model, the request will fail with a 400 error.
user
string

Optional
A stable identifier for your end-users. Used to boost cache hit rates by better bucketing similar requests and to help OpenAI detect and prevent abuse. Learn more.

incomplete_details
object or null

Details about why the response is incomplete.


Show properties
instructions
string or array

A system (or developer) message inserted into the model's context.

When using along with previous_response_id, the instructions from a previous response will not be carried over to the next response. This makes it simple to swap out system (or developer) messages in new responses.


Show possible types
max_output_tokens
integer or null

An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a response, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.

max_tool_calls
integer or null

The maximum number of total calls to built-in tools that can be processed in a response. This maximum number applies across all built-in tool calls, not per individual tool. Any further attempts to call a tool by the model will be ignored.

metadata
map

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.

Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

model
string

Model ID used to generate the response, like gpt-4o or o3. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the model guide to browse and compare available models.

object
string

The object type of this resource - always set to response.

output
array

An array of content items generated by the model.

The length and order of items in the output array is dependent on the model's response.
Rather than accessing the first item in the output array and assuming it's an assistant message with the content generated by the model, you might consider using the output_text property where supported in SDKs.

Show possible types
output_text
string or null

SDK Only
SDK-only convenience property that contains the aggregated text output from all output_text items in the output array, if any are present. Supported in the Python and JavaScript SDKs.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Whether to allow the model to run tool calls in parallel.

previous_response_id
string or null

The unique ID of the previous response to the model. Use this to create multi-turn conversations. Learn more about conversation state.

prompt
object or null

Reference to a prompt template and its variables. Learn more.


Show properties
reasoning
object or null

o-series models only

Configuration options for reasoning models.


Show properties
service_tier
string or null

Specifies the processing type used for serving the request.

If set to 'auto', then the request will be processed with the service tier configured in the Project settings. Unless otherwise configured, the Project will use 'default'.
If set to 'default', then the requset will be processed with the standard pricing and performance for the selected model.
If set to 'flex' or 'priority', then the request will be processed with the corresponding service tier. Contact sales to learn more about Priority processing.
When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.
When the service_tier parameter is set, the response body will include the service_tier value based on the processing mode actually used to serve the request. This response value may be different from the value set in the parameter.

status
string

The status of the response generation. One of completed, failed, in_progress, cancelled, queued, or incomplete.

temperature
number or null

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

text
object

Configuration options for a text response from the model. Can be plain text or structured JSON data. Learn more:

Text inputs and outputs
Structured Outputs

Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

How the model should select which tool (or tools) to use when generating a response. See the tools parameter to see how to specify which tools the model can call.


Show possible types
tools
array

An array of tools the model may call while generating a response. You can specify which tool to use by setting the tool_choice parameter.

The two categories of tools you can provide the model are:

Built-in tools: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the model's capabilities, like web search or file search. Learn more about built-in tools.
Function calls (custom tools): Functions that are defined by you, enabling the model to call your own code. Learn more about function calling.

Show possible types
top_logprobs
integer or null

An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.

top_p
number or null

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

truncation
string or null

The truncation strategy to use for the model response.

auto: If the context of this response and previous ones exceeds the model's context window size, the model will truncate the response to fit the context window by dropping input items in the middle of the conversation.
disabled (default): If a model response will exceed the context window size for a model, the request will fail with a 400 error.
usage
object

Represents token usage details including input tokens, output tokens, a breakdown of output tokens, and the total tokens used.

File inputs
===========

Learn how to use PDF files as inputs to the OpenAI API.

OpenAI models with vision capabilities can also accept PDF files as input. Provide PDFs either as Base64-encoded data or as file IDs obtained after uploading files to the `/v1/files` endpoint through the [API](/docs/api-reference/files) or [dashboard](/storage/files/).

How it works
------------

To help models understand PDF content, we put into the model's context both the extracted text and an image of each page. The model can then use both the text and the images to generate a response. This is useful, for example, if diagrams contain key information that isn't in the text.

File URLs
---------

You can upload PDF file inputs by linking external URLs.

Link an external URL to a file to use in a response

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "input": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "input_file",
                        "file_url": "https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2024ltr.pdf"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "input_text",
                        "text": "Analyze the letter and provide a summary of the key points."
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: [
                {
                    type: "input_file", 
                    file_url: "https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2024ltr.pdf",
                },
                {

                    text: "Analyze the letter and provide a summary of the key points.",
                },
            ],
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [

                    "text": "Analyze the letter and provide a summary of the key points.",
                },
            ],
        },
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

Uploading files
---------------

In the example below, we first upload a PDF using the [Files API](/docs/api-reference/files), then reference its file ID in an API request to the model.

Upload a file to use in a response

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/files \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -F purpose="user_data" \
    -F file="@draconomicon.pdf"

curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "input": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "input_file",
                        "file_id": "file-6F2ksmvXxt4VdoqmHRw6kL"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "input_text",
                        "text": "What is the first dragon in the book?"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }'
```

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const file = await client.files.create({
    file: fs.createReadStream("draconomicon.pdf"),
    purpose: "user_data",
});

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: [
                {
                    type: "input_file",
                    file_id: file.id,
                },
                {
                    type: "input_text",
                    text: "What is the first dragon in the book?",
                },
            ],
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

file = client.files.create(
    file=open("draconomicon.pdf", "rb"),
    purpose="user_data"
)

                    "text": "What is the first dragon in the book?",
                },
            ]
        }
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

Base64-encoded files
--------------------

You can also send PDF file inputs as Base64-encoded inputs.

Base64 encode a file to use in a response

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{

                        "file_data": "...base64 encoded PDF bytes here..."
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "input_text",
                        "text": "What is the first dragon in the book?"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }'
```

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const data = fs.readFileSync("draconomicon.pdf");
const base64String = data.toString("base64");

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: [
                {
                    type: "input_file",
                    filename: "draconomicon.pdf",
                    file_data: `data:application/pdf;base64,${base64String}`,
                },
                {
                    type: "input_text",
                    text: "What is the first dragon in the book?",
                },
            ],
        },
    ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
import base64
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

with open("draconomicon.pdf", "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

base64_string = base64.b64encode(data).decode("utf-8")

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",

                    "file_data": f"data:application/pdf;base64,{base64_string}",
                },
                {
                    "type": "input_text",
                    "text": "What is the first dragon in the book?",
                },
            ],
        },
    ]
)

print(response.output_text)
```

Usage considerations
--------------------

Below are a few considerations to keep in mind while using PDF inputs.

**Token usage**

To help models understand PDF content, we put into the model's context both extracted text and an image of each page—regardless of whether the page includes images. Before deploying your solution at scale, ensure you understand the pricing and token usage implications of using PDFs as input. [More on pricing](/docs/pricing).

**File size limitations**

You can upload up to 100 pages and 32MB of total content in a single request to the API, across multiple file inputs.

**Supported models**

Only models that support both text and image inputs, such as gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, or o1, can accept PDF files as input. [Check model features here](/docs/models).

**File upload purpose**

You can upload these files to the Files API with any [purpose](/docs/api-reference/files/create#files-create-purpose), but we recommend using the `user_data` purpose for files you plan to use as model inputs.

Using tools
===========

Use tools like remote MCP servers or web search to extend the model's capabilities.

When generating model responses, you can extend model capabilities using built-in **tools**. These tools help models access additional context and information from the web or your files. The example below uses the [web search tool](/docs/guides/tools-web-search) to use the latest information from the web to generate a model response.

Include web search results for the model response

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [ { type: "web_search_preview" } ],
    input: "What was a positive news story from today?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
    input="What was a positive news story from today?"
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "tools": [{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
        "input": "what was a positive news story from today?"
    }'
```

You can include several built-in tools from the available tools list below and let the model decide which tools to use based on the conversation.

Usage in the API
----------------

When making a request to generate a [model response](/docs/api-reference/responses/create), you can enable tool access by specifying configurations in the `tools` parameter. Each tool has its own unique configuration requirements—see the [Available tools](#available-tools) section for detailed instructions.

Based on the provided [prompt](/docs/guides/text), the model automatically decides whether to use a configured tool. For instance, if your prompt requests information beyond the model's training cutoff date and web search is enabled, the model will typically invoke the web search tool to retrieve relevant, up-to-date information.

You can explicitly control or guide this behavior by setting the `tool_choice` parameter [in the API request](/docs/api-reference/responses/create).

### Function calling

In addition to built-in tools, you can define custom functions using the `tools` array. These custom functions allow the model to call your application's code, enabling access to specific data or capabilities not directly available within the model.

Learn more in the [function calling guide](/docs/guides/function-calling).

Remote MCP
==========

Allow models to use remote MCP servers to perform tasks.

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide tools and context to LLMs. The MCP tool in the Responses API allows developers to give the model access to tools hosted on **Remote MCP servers**. These are MCP servers maintained by developers and organizations across the internet that expose these tools to MCP clients, like the Responses API.

Calling a remote MCP server with the Responses API is straightforward. For example, here's how you can use the [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/) MCP server to ask questions about nearly any public GitHub repository.

A Responses API request with MCP tools enabled

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "mcp",
      "server_label": "deepwiki",
      "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
      "require_approval": "never"
    }
  ],
  "input": "What transport protocols are supported in the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec?"
}'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const resp = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [
        {
            type: "mcp",
            server_label: "deepwiki",
            server_url: "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
            require_approval: "never",
        },
    ],
    input: "What transport protocols are supported in the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec?",
});

console.log(resp.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "mcp",
            "server_label": "deepwiki",
            "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
            "require_approval": "never",
        },
    ],
    input="What transport protocols are supported in the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec?",
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

It is very important that developers trust any remote MCP server they use with the Responses API. A malicious server can exfiltrate sensitive data from anything that enters the model's context. Carefully review the [Risks and Safety](#risks-and-safety) section below before using this tool.

The MCP ecosystem
-----------------

We are still in the early days of the MCP ecosystem. Some popular remote MCP servers today include [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/guides/remote-mcp-server/), [Hubspot](https://developers.hubspot.com/mcp), [Intercom](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/mcp), [Paypal](https://developer.paypal.com/tools/mcp-server/), [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/mcp/openai/), [Plaid](https://plaid.com/docs/mcp/), [Shopify](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/storefront-mcp), [Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com/mcp), [Square](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/mcp), [Twilio](https://github.com/twilio-labs/function-templates/tree/main/mcp-server) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/mcp). We expect many more servers—and registries making it easy to discover these servers—to launch in the coming months. The MCP protocol itself is also early, and we expect to add many more updates to our MCP tool as the protocol evolves.

How it works
------------

The MCP tool works only in the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses/create), and is available across all our new models (gpt-4o, gpt-4.1, and our reasoning models). When you're using the MCP tool, you only pay for [tokens](/docs/pricing) used when importing tool definitions or making tool calls—there are no additional fees involved.

### Step 1: Getting the list of tools from the MCP server

The first thing the Responses API does when you attach a remote MCP server to the `tools` array, is attempt to get a list of tools from the server. The Responses API supports remote MCP servers that support either the Streamable HTTP or the HTTP/SSE transport protocol.

If successful in retrieving the list of tools, a new `mcp_list_tools` output item will be visible in the Response object that is created for each MCP server. The `tools` property of this object will show the tools that were successfully imported.

```json
{
  "id": "mcpl_682d4379df088191886b70f4ec39f90403937d5f622d7a90",
  "type": "mcp_list_tools",
  "server_label": "deepwiki",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "read_wiki_structure",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "repoName": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "GitHub repository: owner/repo (e.g. \"facebook/react\")"
          }
        },
        "required": [
          "repoName"
        ],
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "annotations": null,
        "description": "",
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"
      }
    },
    // ... other tools
  ]
}
```

As long as the `mcp_list_tools` item is present in the context of the model, we will not attempt to pull a refreshed list of tools from an MCP server. We recommend you keep this item in the model's context as part of every conversation or workflow execution to optimize for latency.

#### Filtering tools

Some MCP servers can have dozens of tools, and exposing many tools to the model can result in high cost and latency. If you're only interested in a subset of tools an MCP server exposes, you can use the `allowed_tools` parameter to only import those tools.

Constrain allowed tools

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "mcp",
      "server_label": "deepwiki",
      "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
      "require_approval": "never",
      "allowed_tools": ["ask_question"]
    }
  ],
  "input": "What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?"
}'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const resp = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [{
        type: "mcp",
        server_label: "deepwiki",
        server_url: "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
        require_approval: "never",
        allowed_tools: ["ask_question"],
    }],
    input: "What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?",
});

console.log(resp.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "deepwiki",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
        "require_approval": "never",
        "allowed_tools": ["ask_question"],
    }],
    input="What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?",
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

### Step 2: Calling tools

Once the model has access to these tool definitions, it may choose to call them depending on what's in the model's context. When the model decides to call an MCP tool, we make an request to the remote MCP server to call the tool, take it's output and put that into the model's context. This creates an `mcp_call` item which looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "mcp_682d437d90a88191bf88cd03aae0c3e503937d5f622d7a90",
  "type": "mcp_call",
  "approval_request_id": null,
  "arguments": "{\"repoName\":\"modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol\",\"question\":\"What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec support?\"}",
  "error": null,
  "name": "ask_question",
  "output": "The 2025-03-26 version of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification supports two standard transport mechanisms: `stdio` and `Streamable HTTP` ...",
  "server_label": "deepwiki"
}
```

As you can see, this includes both the arguments the model decided to use for this tool call, and the `output` that the remote MCP server returned. All models can choose to make multiple (MCP) tool calls in the Responses API, and so, you may see several of these items generated in a single Response API request.

Failed tool calls will populate the error field of this item with MCP protocol errors, MCP tool execution errors, or general connectivity errors. The MCP errors are documented in the MCP spec [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/server/tools#error-handling).

#### Approvals

By default, OpenAI will request your approval before any data is shared with a remote MCP server. Approvals help you maintain control and visibility over what data is being sent to an MCP server. We highly recommend that you carefully review (and optionally, log) all data being shared with a remote MCP server. A request for an approval to make an MCP tool call creates a `mcp_approval_request` item in the Response's output that looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "mcpr_682d498e3bd4819196a0ce1664f8e77b04ad1e533afccbfa",
  "type": "mcp_approval_request",
  "arguments": "{\"repoName\":\"modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol\",\"question\":\"What transport protocols are supported in the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec?\"}",
  "name": "ask_question",
  "server_label": "deepwiki"
}
```

You can then respond to this by creating a new Response object and appending an `mcp_approval_response` item to it.

Approving the use of tools in an API request

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "mcp",
      "server_label": "deepwiki",
      "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp"
    }
  ],
  "previous_response_id": "resp_682d498bdefc81918b4a6aa477bfafd904ad1e533afccbfa",
  "input": [{
    "type": "mcp_approval_response",
    "approve": true,
    "approval_request_id": "mcpr_682d498e3bd4819196a0ce1664f8e77b04ad1e533afccbfa"
  }]
}'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const resp = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [{
        type: "mcp",
        server_label: "deepwiki",
        server_url: "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
    }],
    previous_response_id: "resp_682d498bdefc81918b4a6aa477bfafd904ad1e533afccbfa",
    input: [{
        type: "mcp_approval_response",
        approve: true,
        approval_request_id: "mcpr_682d498e3bd4819196a0ce1664f8e77b04ad1e533afccbfa"
    }],
});

console.log(resp.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "deepwiki",
        "server_url": "https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp",
    }],
    previous_response_id="resp_682d498bdefc81918b4a6aa477bfafd904ad1e533afccbfa",
    input=[{
        "type": "mcp_approval_response",
        "approve": True,
        "approval_request_id": "mcpr_682d498e3bd4819196a0ce1664f8e77b04ad1e533afccbfa"
    }],
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

Here we're using the `previous_response_id` parameter to chain this new Response, with the previous Response that generated the approval request. But you can also pass back the [outputs from one response, as inputs into another](/docs/guides/conversation-state#manually-manage-conversation-state) for maximum control over what enter's the model's context.

If and when you feel comfortable trusting a remote MCP server, you can choose to skip the approvals for reduced latency. To do this, you can set the `require_approval` parameter of the MCP tool to an object listing just the tools you'd like to skip approvals for like shown below, or set it to the value `'never'` to skip approvals for all tools in that remote MCP server.

Never require approval for some tools

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "gpt-4.1",

      "require_approval": {
          "never": {
            "tool_names": ["ask_question", "read_wiki_structure"]
          }
      }
    }
  ],
  "input": "What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?"
}'
```

```javascript

    model: "gpt-4.1",

                }
            }
        },
    ],
    input: "What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?",
});

console.log(resp.output_text);
```

```python

            "require_approval": {

                    "tool_names": ["ask_question", "read_wiki_structure"]
                }
            }
        },
    ],
    input="What transport protocols does the 2025-03-26 version of the MCP spec (modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) support?",
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

Authentication
--------------

Unlike the DeepWiki MCP server, most other MCP servers require authentication. The MCP tool in the Responses API gives you the ability to flexibly specify headers that should be included in any request made to a remote MCP server. These headers can be used to share API keys, oAuth access tokens, or any other authentication scheme the remote MCP server implements.

The most common header used by remote MCP servers is the `Authorization` header. This is what passing this header looks like:

Use Stripe MCP tool

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "input": "Create a payment link for $20",
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "mcp",
      "server_label": "stripe",
      "server_url": "https://mcp.stripe.com",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer $STRIPE_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const resp = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    input: "Create a payment link for $20",
    tools: [
        {
            type: "mcp",
            server_label: "stripe",
            server_url: "https://mcp.stripe.com",
            headers: {
                Authorization: "Bearer $STRIPE_API_KEY"
            }
        }
    ]
});

console.log(resp.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

resp = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    input="Create a payment link for $20",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "mcp",
            "server_label": "stripe",
            "server_url": "https://mcp.stripe.com",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer $STRIPE_API_KEY"
            }
        }
    ]
)

print(resp.output_text)
```

To prevent the leakage of sensitive keys, the Responses API does not store the values of **any** string you provide in the `headers` object. These values will also not be visible in the Response object created. Additionally, because some remote MCP servers generate authenticated URLs, we also discard the _path_ portion of the `server_url` in our responses (i.e. `example.com/mcp` becomes `example.com`). Because of this, you must send the full path of the MCP `server_url` and any relevant `headers` in every Responses API creation request you make.

Risks and safety
----------------

The MCP tool permits you to connect OpenAI to services that have not been verified by OpenAI and allows OpenAI to access, send and receive data, and take action in these services. All MCP servers are third-party services that are subject to their own terms and conditions.

If you come across a malicious MCP server, please report it to `security@openai.com`.

#### Connecting to trusted servers

Pick official servers hosted by the service providers themselves (e.g. we recommend connecting to the Stripe server hosted by Stripe themselves on mcp.stripe.com, instead of a Stripe MCP server hosted by a third party). Because there aren't too many official remote MCP servers today, you may be tempted to use a MCP server hosted by an organization that doesn't operate that server and simply proxies request to that service via your API. If you must do this, be extra careful in doing your due diligence on these "aggregators", and carefully review how they use your data.

#### Log and review data being shared with third party MCP servers.

Because MCP servers define their own tool definitions, they may request for data that you may not always be comfortable sharing with the host of that MCP server. Because of this, the MCP tool in the Responses API defaults to requiring approvals of each MCP tool call being made. When developing your application, review the type of data being shared with these MCP servers carefully and robustly. Once you gain confidence in your trust of this MCP server, you can skip these approvals for more performant execution.

We also recommend logging any data sent to MCP servers. If you're using the Responses API with `store=true`, these data are already logged via the API for 30 days unless Zero Data Retention is enabled for your organization. You may also want to log these data in your own systems and perform periodic reviews on this to ensure data is being shared per your expectations.

Malicious MCP servers may include hidden instructions (prompt injections) designed to make OpenAI models behave unexpectedly. While OpenAI has implemented built-in safeguards to help detect and block these threats, it's essential to carefully review inputs and outputs, and ensure connections are established only with trusted servers.

MCP servers may update tool behavior unexpectedly, potentially leading to unintended or malicious behavior.

#### Implications on Zero Data Retention and Data Residency

The MCP tool is compatible with Zero Data Retention and Data Residency, but it's important to note that MCP servers are third-party services, and data sent to an MCP server is subject to their data retention and data residency policies.

In other words, if you're an organization with Data Residency in Europe, OpenAI will limit inference and storage of Customer Content to take place in Europe up until the point communication or data is sent to the MCP server. It is your responsibility to ensure that the MCP server also adheres to any Zero Data Retention or Data Residency requirements you may have. Learn more about Zero Data Retention and Data Residency [here](/docs/guides/your-data).

Web search
==========

Allow models to search the web for the latest information before generating a response.

Using the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses), you can enable web search by configuring it in the `tools` array in an API request to generate content. Like any other tool, the model can choose to search the web or not based on the content of the input prompt.

Web search tool example

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const response = await client.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [ { type: "web_search_preview" } ],
    input: "What was a positive news story from today?",
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
    input="What was a positive news story from today?"
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "tools": [{"type": "web_search_preview"}],
        "input": "what was a positive news story from today?"
    }'
```

Web search tool versions

The current default version of the web search tool is:

`web_search_preview`

Which points to a dated version:

`web_search_preview_2025_03_11`

As the tool evolves, future dated snapshot versions will be documented in the [API reference](/docs/api-reference/responses/create).

You can also force the use of the `web_search_preview` tool by using the `tool_choice` parameter, and setting it to `{type: "web_search_preview"}` - this can help ensure lower latency and more consistent results.

Output and citations
--------------------

Model responses that use the web search tool will include two parts:

*   A `web_search_call` output item with the ID of the search call, along with the action taken in `web_search_call.action`. The action is one of:
    *   `search`, which represents a web search. It will usually (but not always) includes the search `query` and `domains` which were searched. Search actions incur a tool call cost (see [pricing](/docs/pricing#built-in-tools)).
    *   `open_page`, which represents a page being opened. Only emitted by Deep Research models.
    *   `find_in_page`, which represents searching within a page. Only emitted by Deep Research models.
*   A `message` output item containing:
    *   The text result in `message.content[0].text`
    *   Annotations `message.content[0].annotations` for the cited URLs

By default, the model's response will include inline citations for URLs found in the web search results. In addition to this, the `url_citation` annotation object will contain the URL, title and location of the cited source.

When displaying web results or information contained in web results to end users, inline citations must be made clearly visible and clickable in your user interface.

User location
-------------

To refine search results based on geography, you can specify an approximate user location using country, city, region, and/or timezone.

*   The `city` and `region` fields are free text strings, like `Minneapolis` and `Minnesota` respectively.
*   The `country` field is a two-letter [ISO country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1), like `US`.
*   The `timezone` field is an [IANA timezone](https://timeapi.io/documentation/iana-timezones) like `America/Chicago`.

Note that user location is not supported for deep research models using web search.

Customizing user location

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="o4-mini",
    tools=[{
        "type": "web_search_preview",
        "user_location": {
            "type": "approximate",
            "country": "GB",
            "city": "London",
            "region": "London",
        }
    }],
    input="What are the best restaurants around Granary Square?",
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "o4-mini",
    tools: [{
        type: "web_search_preview",
        user_location: {
            type: "approximate",
            country: "GB",
            city: "London",
            region: "London"
        }
    }],
    input: "What are the best restaurants around Granary Square?",
});
console.log(response.output_text);
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "o4-mini",
        "tools": [{
            "type": "web_search_preview",
            "user_location": {
                "type": "approximate",
                "country": "GB",
                "city": "London",
                "region": "London"
            }
        }],
        "input": "What are the best restaurants around Granary Square?"
    }'
```

Search context size
-------------------

When using this tool, the `search_context_size` parameter controls how much context is retrieved from the web to help the tool formulate a response. The tokens used by the search tool do **not** affect the context window of the main model specified in the `model` parameter in your response creation request. These tokens are also **not** carried over from one turn to another — they're simply used to formulate the tool response and then discarded.

Choosing a context size impacts:

*   **Cost**: Search content tokens are free for some models, but may be billed at a model's text token rates for others. Refer to [pricing](/docs/pricing#built-in-tools) for details.
*   **Quality**: Higher search context sizes generally provide richer context, resulting in more accurate, comprehensive answers.
*   **Latency**: Higher context sizes require processing more tokens, which can slow down the tool's response time.

Available values:

*   **`high`**: Most comprehensive context, slower response.
*   **`medium`** (default): Balanced context and latency.
*   **`low`**: Least context, fastest response, but potentially lower answer quality.

Context size configuration is not supported for o3, o3-pro, o4-mini, and deep research models.

Customizing search context size

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{
        "type": "web_search_preview",
        "search_context_size": "low",
    }],
    input="What movie won best picture in 2025?",
)

print(response.output_text)
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI();

const response = await openai.responses.create({
    model: "gpt-4.1",
    tools: [{
        type: "web_search_preview",
        search_context_size: "low",
    }],
    input: "What movie won best picture in 2025?",
});
console.log(response.output_text);
```

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/responses" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "tools": [{
            "type": "web_search_preview",
            "search_context_size": "low"
        }],
        "input": "What movie won best picture in 2025?"
    }'
```

Usage notes

#### Limitations

*   Web search is currently not supported in the [`gpt-4.1-nano`](/docs/models/gpt-4.1-nano) model.
*   The [`gpt-4o-search-preview`](/docs/models/gpt-4o-search-preview) and [`gpt-4o-mini-search-preview`](/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini-search-preview) models used in Chat Completions only support a subset of API parameters - view their model data pages for specific information on rate limits and feature support.
*   When used as a tool in the [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses), web search has the same tiered rate limits as the models above.
*   Web search is limited to a context window size of 128000 (even with [`gpt-4.1`](/docs/models/gpt-4.1) and [`gpt-4.1-mini`](/docs/models/gpt-4.1-mini) models).
*   [Refer to this guide](/docs/guides/your-data) for data handling, residency, and retention information.
